## openFlow exercise

---
Application of a flow with 200 random particles and testing two piv-files that filter a vector plot with a given signal-to-noise ratio in a material model. Direct scaling is done uniformly with a factor below 100 and an area search of an image in extended frames with a method between two peaks by thresholds of 1.2. An overlap of 16 and 32 has been chosen and a validation with a local mean is supposed.
