## openBulk exercise

---
Demonstration of a solid model with 200 random uniform particles and testing two piv-files that filter a vector plot with a given signal-to-noise ration of an image. Direct scaling is done uniform with a factor below 100 and an area search with 64 in 128 pixel with a method between two peaks with threshold 1.2. An overlap of 16 and 32 has been chosen.
