## openBulk exercise

---
Demonstration of a solid model with 200 random particles and testing two piv-files that filter a vector plot with a given signal-to-noise ration of an image. Direct scaling is done uniform with a factor below 100 and as area search of 64 in 128 pixels with a method between two peaks with thresholds of 1.2. An overlap of 16 and 32 has been chosen and a validation with a local mean is supposed.
